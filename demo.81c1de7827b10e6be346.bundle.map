target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://bhsource.bullhorn.com/NOVO/bh-elements/blob/master/src/elements/button\">(source)</a></small></h1>\\n    <p>A button clearly indicates a point of action for the user. Bullhorn buttons\\n     come in a variety of themes, custom tailored to fit your use-case.</p>\\n    \\n    <h2>Themes</h2>\\n    <p>\\n        Bullhorn button themes were hand crafted to make your life easier.\\n         Most buttons used in the Bullhorn platform should utilize a\\n         <code>theme</code> attribute. Theme attributes provide access to every\\n         variation of Bullhorn UX approved buttons. Depending on the theme, some\\n         buttons may also utilize <code>icon</code>, <code>side</code>, and\\n         <code>inverse</code> attributes. Button are divided by function into\\n         four main categories: Primary, Secondary, Neutralizing, Subtractive.\\n         There are also three other button types that are independent of function:\\n         Dialogue, Icon, and Header.\\n    </p>\\n    \\n    <h5>Colors</h5>\\n    <p>\\n        Acceptable colors include <code>Primary</code>, <code>Success</code>, <code>Warning</code>, <code>Negative</code>,\\n         and <strong>all analytics colors</strong> which can be found in the color section of the style guide.\\n    </p>\\n    \\n    <br/>\\n    \\n    <h5>Primary</h5>\\n    <p>\\n        Primary buttons are used to as primary calls-to-action. They should <strong>always</strong>\\n         get an <code>icon</code> attribute. Primary buttons with a \"success\" color\\n         <code>color=\"success\"</code> are used for saving and will almost always contain a \"check\" icon.\\n         Negative color primary buttons <code>color=\"negative\"</code> are used to delete,\\n         clear, or otherwise remove an extant element. Primary buttons should never have a <code>side</code> attribute.\\n    </p>\\n    <div class=\"example buttons-demo\">' + _PrimaryButtonDemo2.default + '</div>\\n    <code-snippet [code]=\"PrimaryButtonDemoTpl\"></code-snippet>\\n    \\n    <h5>Secondary</h5>\\n    <p>\\n        Secondary buttons are used as an alternative Primary button or when there\\n         is a second major action on a page. They usually appears only in Overview\\n         and Slideout headers. This theme with an <code>inverse</code> attribute is\\n         often used as the action button in dropdown menus.\\n    </p>\\n    <div class=\"example buttons-demo\">' + _SecondaryButtonDemo2.default + '</div>\\n    <code-snippet [code]=\"SecondaryButtonDemoTpl\"></code-snippet>\\n    <p>\\n        Secondary buttons can also get an <code>inverse</code> attribute for use on a colored background.\\n    </p>\\n    <div class=\"example header buttons-demo\" [ngClass]=\"color\" (click)=\"changeColor()\" bhTooltip=\"Click Me!\" bhTooltipPlacement=\"top\">' + _HeaderButtonDemo2.default + '</div>\\n    <code-snippet [code]=\"HeaderButtonDemoTpl\"></code-snippet>\\n    \\n    <h5>Dialogue</h5>\\n    <p>\\n        Similar to icon buttons, dialogue buttons require less visual dominance but often need additional helper text. Dialogue buttons\\n        <em>may</em> contain <strong>any</strong> icon and a\\n        <code>side</code> may be specified eg:<code>side=\"right\"</code> to place the icon on the right or left side of the text. Dialogue buttons may also use an\\n        <code>inverse</code> attribute to change its text color to white.\\n    </p>\\n    <div class=\"example buttons-demo\">' + _DialogueButtonDemo2.default + '</div>\\n    <code-snippet [code]=\"DialogueButtonDemoTpl\"></code-snippet>\\n    \\n    <h5>Standard</h5>\\n    <p>\\n        Standard buttons are the most generic button style. Standard buttons by default are\\n         styled identically to standard buttons with a <code>color=\"light\"</code>\\n         attribute. Typically, a standard button is used to cancel an action,\\n         or to cease any additional progress. Although standard buttons <em>can</em>\\n         get an <code>icon</code> attribute, they should almost never be used with an icon.\\n         If your proposed design calls for a standard button with an icon, consider using\\n         a different button theme, like dialogue.\\n    </p>\\n    <div class=\"example buttons-demo\">' + _StandardButtonDemo2.default + '</div>\\n    <code-snippet [code]=\"NeutralButtonDemoTpl\"></code-snippet>\\n    \\n    <h5>Icon</h5>\\n    <p>\\n        The <code>icon</code> theme is used to create\\n        <strong>icon-only</strong> buttons, which contain no text. They can occupy any of the four main functions but require far less visual dominance than normal buttons. Icon buttons\\n        <strong>always</strong> have an <code>icon</code> attribute and can use\\n        <strong>any</strong> icon. Icon buttons may also use an\\n        <code>inverse</code> attribute to change its icon color to white.\\n    </p>\\n    <div class=\"example buttons-demo icons\" [ngClass]=\"color\"

This is\r\n\t * mainly for security reasons, as well as architectural changes in Angular 2. This means\r\n\t * that `index.html` can safely be processed using server-side technologies such as\r\n\t * providers. Bindings can thus use double-curly `{{ syntax }}` without collision from\r\n\t * Angular 2 component double-curly `{{ syntax }}`.\r\n\t *\r\n\t * We can use this script code:\r\n\t *\r\n\t * {@example core/ts/bootstrap/bootstrap.ts region='bootstrap'}\r\n\t *\r\n\t * When the app developer invokes `bootstrap()` with the root component `MyApp` as its\r\n\t * argument, Angular performs the following tasks:\r\n\t *\r\n\t *  1. It uses the component's `selector` property to locate the DOM element which needs\r\n\t *     to be upgraded into the angular component.\r\n\t *  2. It creates a new child injector (from the platform injector). Optionally, you can\r\n\t *     also override the injector configuration for an app by invoking `bootstrap` with the\r\n\t *     `componentInjectableBindings` argument.\r\n\t *  3. It creates a new `Zone` and connects it to the angular application's change detection\r\n\t *     domain instance.\r\n\t *  4. It creates an emulated or shadow DOM on the selected component's host element and loads the\r\n\t *     template into it.\r\n\t *  5. It instantiates the specified component.\r\n\t *  6. Finally, Angular performs change detection to apply the initial data providers for the\r\n\t *     application.\r\n\t *\r\n\t *\r\n\t * ## Bootstrapping Multiple Applications\r\n\t *\r\n\t * When working within a browser window, there are many singleton resources: cookies, title,\r\n\t * location, and others. Angular services that represent these resources must likewise be\r\n\t * shared across all Angular applications that occupy the same browser window. For this\r\n\t * reason, Angular creates exactly one global platform object which stores all shared\r\n\t * services, and each angular application injector has the platform injector as its parent.\r\n\t *\r\n\t * Each application has its own private injector as well. When there are multiple\r\n\t * applications on a page, Angular treats each application injector's services as private\r\n\t * to that application.\r\n\t *\r\n\t * ## API\r\n\t *\r\n\t * - `appComponentType`: The root component which should act as the application.

The goal is to allow users to avoid the\r\n\t  most obvious pitfalls and do so without compromising performance significantly.\r\n\t  For ShadowDOM styling that's not covered here, a set of best practices\r\n\t  can be provided that should allow users to accomplish more complex styling.\r\n\t\r\n\t  The following is a list of specific ShadowDOM styling features and a brief\r\n\t  discussion of the approach used to shim.\r\n\t\r\n\t  Shimmed features:\r\n\t\r\n\t  * :host, :host-context: ShadowDOM allows styling of the shadowRoot's host\r\n\t  element using the :host rule. To shim this feature, the :host styles are\r\n\t  reformatted and prefixed with a given scope name and promoted to a\r\n\t  document level stylesheet.\r\n\t  For example, given a scope name of .foo, a rule like this:\r\n\t\r\n\t    :host {\r\n\t        background: red;\r\n\t      }\r\n\t    }\r\n\t\r\n\t  becomes:\r\n\t\r\n\t    .foo {\r\n\t      background: red;\r\n\t    }\r\n\t\r\n\t  * encapsultion: Styles defined within ShadowDOM, apply only to\r\n\t  dom inside the ShadowDOM. Polymer uses one of two techniques to implement\r\n\t  this feature.\r\n\t\r\n\t  By default, rules are prefixed with the host element tag name\r\n\t  as a descendant selector. This ensures styling does not leak out of the 'top'\r\n\t  of the element's ShadowDOM. For example,\r\n\t\r\n\t  div {\r\n\t      font-weight: bold;\r\n\t    }\r\n\t\r\n\t  becomes:\r\n\t\r\n\t  x-foo div {\r\n\t      font-weight: bold;\r\n\t    }\r\n\t\r\n\t  becomes:\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t  Alternatively, if WebComponents.ShadowCSS.strictStyling is set to true then\r\n\t  selectors are scoped by adding an attribute selector suffix to each\r\n\t  simple selector that contains the host element tag name. Each element\r\n\t  in the element's ShadowDOM template is also given the scope attribute.\r\n\t  Thus, these rules match only elements that have the scope attribute.\r\n\t  For example, given a scope name of x-foo, a rule like this:\r\n\t\r\n\t    div {\r\n\t      font-weight: bold;\r\n\t    }\r\n\t\r\n\t  becomes:\r\n\t\r\n\t    div[x-foo] {\r\n\t      font-weight: bold;\r\n\t    }\r\n\t\r\n\t  Note that elements that are dynamically added to a scope must have the scope\r\n\t  selector added to them manually.\r\n\t\r\n\t  * upper/lower bound encapsulation: Styles which are defined outside a\r\n\t  shadowRoot should not cross the ShadowDOM boundary and should not apply\r\n\t  inside a shadowRoot.\r\n\t\r\n\t  This styling behavior is not emulated. Some possible ways to do this that\r\n\t  were rejected due to complexity and/or performance concerns include: (1) reset\r\n\t  every possible property for every possible selector for a given scope name;\r\n\t  (2) re-implement css in javascript.\r\n\t\r\n\t  As an alternative, users should make sure to use selectors\r\n\t  specific to the scope in which they are working.\r\n\t\r\n\t  * ::distributed: This behavior is not emulated. It's often not necessary\r\n\t  to style the contents of a specific insertion point and instead, descendants\r\n\t  of the host element can be styled selectively. Users can also create an\r\n\t  extra node around an insertion point and style that node's contents\r\n\t  via descendent selectors.

Primary buttons with a \"success\" color\\n         <code>color=\"success\"</code> are used for saving and will almost always contain a \"check\" icon.\\n         Negative color primary buttons <code>color=\"negative\"</code> are used to delete,\\n         clear, or otherwise remove an extant element.

Dialogue buttons\\n        <em>may</em> contain <strong>any</strong> icon and a\\n        <code>side</code> may be specified eg:<code>side=\"right\"</code> to place the icon on the right or left side of the text. Dialogue buttons may also use an\\n        <code>inverse</code> attribute to change its text color to white.\\n    </p>\\n    <div class=\"example buttons-demo\">' + _DialogueButtonDemo2.default + '</div>\\n    <code-snippet [code]=\"DialogueButtonDemoTpl\"></code-snippet>\\n    \\n    <h5>Standard</h5>\\n    <p>\\n        Standard buttons are the most generic button style. Standard buttons by default are\\n         styled identically to standard buttons with a <code>color=\"light\"</code>\\n         attribute. Typically, a standard button is used to cancel an action,\\n         or to cease any additional progress. Although standard buttons <em>can</em>\\n         get an <code>icon</code> attribute, they should almost never be used with an icon.\\n         If your proposed design calls for a standard button with an icon, consider using\\n         a different button theme, like dialogue.\\n    </p>\\n    <div class=\"example buttons-demo\">' + _StandardButtonDemo2.default + '</div>\\n    <code-snippet [code]=\"NeutralButtonDemoTpl\"></code-snippet>\\n    \\n    <h5>Icon</h5>\\n    <p>\\n        The <code>icon</code> theme is used to create\\n        <strong>icon-only</strong> buttons, which contain no text. They can occupy any of the four main functions but require far less visual dominance than normal buttons. Icon buttons\\n        <strong>always</strong> have an <code>icon</code> attribute and can use\\n        <strong>any</strong> icon. Icon buttons may also use an\\n        <code>inverse</code> attribute to change its icon color to white.\\n    </p>\\n    <div class=\"example buttons-demo icons\" [ngClass]=\"color\"

This is\n * mainly for security reasons, as well as architectural changes in Angular 2. This means\n * that `index.html` can safely be processed using server-side technologies such as\n * providers. Bindings can thus use double-curly `{{ syntax }}` without collision from\n * Angular 2 component double-curly `{{ syntax }}`.\n *\n * We can use this script code:\n *\n * {@example core/ts/bootstrap/bootstrap.ts region='bootstrap'}\n *\n * When the app developer invokes `bootstrap()` with the root component `MyApp` as its\n * argument, Angular performs the following tasks:\n *\n *  1. It uses the component's `selector` property to locate the DOM element which needs\n *     to be upgraded into the angular component.\n *  2. It creates a new child injector (from the platform injector). Optionally, you can\n *     also override the injector configuration for an app by invoking `bootstrap` with the\n *     `componentInjectableBindings` argument.\n *  3. It creates a new `Zone` and connects it to the angular application's change detection\n *     domain instance.\n *  4. It creates an emulated or shadow DOM on the selected component's host element and loads the\n *     template into it.\n *  5. It instantiates the specified component.\n *  6. Finally, Angular performs change detection to apply the initial data providers for the\n *     application.\n *\n *\n * ## Bootstrapping Multiple Applications\n *\n * When working within a browser window, there are many singleton resources: cookies, title,\n * location, and others. Angular services that represent these resources must likewise be\n * shared across all Angular applications that occupy the same browser window. For this\n * reason, Angular creates exactly one global platform object which stores all shared\n * services, and each angular application injector has the platform injector as its parent.\n *\n * Each application has its own private injector as well.

The goal is to allow users to avoid the\n  most obvious pitfalls and do so without compromising performance significantly.\n  For ShadowDOM styling that's not covered here, a set of best practices\n  can be provided that should allow users to accomplish more complex styling.\n\n  The following is a list of specific ShadowDOM styling features and a brief\n  discussion of the approach used to shim.\n\n  Shimmed features:\n\n  * :host, :host-context: ShadowDOM allows styling of the shadowRoot's host\n  element using the :host rule. To shim this feature, the :host styles are\n  reformatted and prefixed with a given scope name and promoted to a\n  document level stylesheet.\n  For example, given a scope name of .foo, a rule like this:\n\n    :host {\n        background: red;\n      }\n    }\n\n  becomes:\n\n    .foo {\n      background: red;\n    }\n\n  * encapsultion: Styles defined within ShadowDOM, apply only to\n  dom inside the ShadowDOM. Polymer uses one of two techniques to implement\n  this feature.\n\n  By default, rules are prefixed with the host element tag name\n  as a descendant selector. This ensures styling does not leak out of the 'top'\n  of the element's ShadowDOM. For example,\n\n  div {\n      font-weight: bold;\n    }\n\n  becomes:\n\n  x-foo div {\n      font-weight: bold;\n    }\n\n  becomes:\n\n\n  Alternatively, if WebComponents.ShadowCSS.strictStyling is set to true then\n  selectors are scoped by adding an attribute selector suffix to each\n  simple selector that contains the host element tag name. Each element\n  in the element's ShadowDOM template is also given the scope attribute.\n  Thus, these rules match only elements that have the scope attribute.\n  For example, given a scope name of x-foo, a rule like this:\n\n    div {\n      font-weight: bold;\n    }\n\n  becomes:\n\n    div[x-foo] {\n      font-weight: bold;\n    }\n\n  Note that elements that are dynamically added to a scope must have the scope\n  selector added to them manually.\n\n  * upper/lower bound encapsulation: Styles which are defined outside a\n  shadowRoot should not cross the ShadowDOM boundary and should not apply\n  inside a shadowRoot.\n\n  This styling behavior is not emulated. Some possible ways to do this that\n  were rejected due to complexity and/or performance concerns include: (1) reset\n  every possible property for every possible selector for a given scope name;\n  (2) re-implement css in javascript.\n\n  As an alternative, users should make sure to use selectors\n  specific to the scope in which they are working.\n\n  * ::distributed: This behavior is not emulated. It's often not necessary\n  to style the contents of a specific insertion point and instead, descendants\n  of the host element can be styled selectively. Users can also create an\n  extra node around an insertion point and style that node's contents\n  via descendent selectors. For example, with a shadowRoot like this:\n\n    <style>\n      ::content(div) {\n        background: red;\n      }\n    </style>\n    <content></content>\n\n  could become:\n\n    <style>\n      / *@polyfill .content-container div * /\n      ::content(div) {\n        background: red;\n      }\n    </style>\n    <div class=\"content-container\">\n      <content></content>\n    </div>\n\n  Note the use of @polyfill in the comment above a ShadowDOM specific style\n  declaration. This is a directive to the styling shim to use the selector\n  in comments in lieu of the next selector when running under polyfill.\n*/\n\nexport class ShadowCss {\n  strictStyling: boolean = true;\n\n  constructor() {}\n\n  /*\n  * Shim some cssText with the given selector.
