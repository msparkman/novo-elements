When the\r\n\t * directive's `selector` matches\r\n\t * elements in the DOM, the following steps occur:\r\n\t *\r\n\t * 1. For each directive, the `ElementInjector` attempts to resolve the directive's constructor\r\n\t * arguments.\r\n\t * 2. Angular instantiates directives for each matched element using `ElementInjector` in a\r\n\t * depth-first order,\r\n\t *    as declared in the HTML.\r\n\t *\r\n\t * ## Understanding How Injection Works\r\n\t *\r\n\t * There are three stages of injection resolution.\r\n\t * - *Pre-existing Injectors*:\r\n\t *   - The terminal {@link Injector} cannot resolve dependencies. It either throws an error or, if\r\n\t * the dependency was\r\n\t *     specified as `@Optional`, returns `null`.\r\n\t *   - The platform injector resolves browser singleton resources, such as: cookies, title,\r\n\t * location, and others.\r\n\t * - *Component Injectors*: Each component instance has its own {@link Injector}, and they follow\r\n\t * the same parent-child hierarchy\r\n\t *     as the component instances in the DOM.\r\n\t * - *Element Injectors*: Each component instance has a Shadow DOM. Within the Shadow DOM each\r\n\t * element has an `ElementInjector`\r\n\t *     which follow the same parent-child hierarchy as the DOM elements themselves.\r\n\t *\r\n\t * When a template is instantiated, it also must instantiate the corresponding directives in a\r\n\t * depth-first order. The\r\n\t * current `ElementInjector` resolves the constructor dependencies for each directive.\r\n\t *\r\n\t * Angular then resolves dependencies as follows, according to the order in which they appear in the\r\n\t * {@link ViewMetadata}:\r\n\t *\r\n\t * 1. Dependencies on the current element\r\n\t * 2. Dependencies on element injectors and their parents until it encounters a Shadow DOM boundary\r\n\t * 3. Dependencies on component injectors and their parents until it encounters the root component\r\n\t * 4. Dependencies on pre-existing injectors\r\n\t *\r\n\t *\r\n\t * The `ElementInjector` can inject other directives, element-specific special objects, or it can\r\n\t * delegate to the parent\r\n\t * injector.\r\n\t *\r\n\t * To inject other directives, declare the constructor parameter as:\r\n\t * - `directive:DirectiveType`: a directive on the current element only\r\n\t * - `@Host() directive:DirectiveType`: any directive that matches the type between the current\r\n\t * element and the\r\n\t *    Shadow DOM root.\r\n\t * - `@Query(DirectiveType) query:QueryList<DirectiveType>`: A live collection of direct child\r\n\t * directives.\r\n\t * - `@QueryDescendants(DirectiveType) query:QueryList<DirectiveType>`: A live collection of any\r\n\t * child directives.\r\n\t *\r\n\t * To inject element-specific special objects, declare the constructor parameter as:\r\n\t * - `element: ElementRef` to obtain a reference to logical element in the view.\r\n\t * - `viewContainer: ViewContainerRef` to control child template instantiation, for\r\n\t * {@link DirectiveMetadata} directives only\r\n\t * - `bindingPropagation: BindingPropagation` to control change detection in a more granular way.\r\n\t *\r\n\t * ### Example\r\n\t *\r\n\t * The following example demonstrates how dependency injection resolves constructor arguments in\r\n\t * practice.\r\n\t *\r\n\t *\r\n\t * Assume this HTML template:\r\n\t *\r\n\t * ```\r\n\t * <div dependency=\"1\">\r\n\t *   <div dependency=\"2\">\r\n\t *     <div dependency=\"3\" my-directive>\r\n\t *       <div dependency=\"4\">\r\n\t *         <div dependency=\"5\"></div>\r\n\t *       </div>\r\n\t *       <div dependency=\"6\"></div>\r\n\t *     </div>\r\n\t *   </div>\r\n\t * </div>\r\n\t * ```\r\n\t *\r\n\t * With the following `dependency` decorator and `SomeService` injectable class.\r\n\t *\r\n\t * ```\r\n\t * @Injectable()\r\n\t * class SomeService {\r\n\t * }\r\n\t *\r\n\t * @Directive({\r\n\t *   selector: '[dependency]',\r\n\t *   inputs: [\r\n\t *     'id: dependency'\r\n\t *   ]\r\n\t * })\r\n\t * class Dependency {\r\n\t *   id:string;\r\n\t * }\r\n\t * ```\r\n\t *\r\n\t * Let's step through the different ways in which `MyDirective` could be declared...\r\n\t *\r\n\t *\r\n\t * ### No injection\r\n\t *\r\n\t * Here the constructor is declared with no arguments, therefore nothing is injected into\r\n\t * `MyDirective`.\r\n\t *\r\n\t * ```\r\n\t * @Directive({ selector: '[my-directive]' })\r\n\t * class MyDirective {\r\n\t *   constructor() {\r\n\t *   }\r\n\t * }\r\n\t * ```\r\n\t *\r\n\t * This directive would be instantiated with no dependencies.\r\n\t *\r\n\t *\r\n\t * ### Component-level injection\r\n\t *\r\n\t * Directives can inject any injectable instance from the closest component injector or any of its\r\n\t * parents.\r\n\t *\r\n\t * Here, the constructor declares a parameter, `someService`, and injects the `SomeService` type\r\n\t * from the parent\r\n\t * component's injector.\r\n\t * ```\r\n\t * @Directive({ selector: '[my-directive]' })\r\n\t * class MyDirective {\r\n\t *   constructor(someService: SomeService) {\r\n\t *   }\r\n\t * }\r\n\t * ```\r\n\t *\r\n\t * This directive would be instantiated with a dependency on `SomeService`.\r\n\t *\r\n\t *\r\n\t * ### Injecting a directive from the current element\r\n\t *\r\n\t * Directives can inject other directives declared on the current element.\r\n\t *\r\n\t * ```\r\n\t * @Directive({ selector: '[my-directive]' })\r\n\t * class MyDirective {\r\n\t *   constructor(dependency: Dependency) {\r\n\t *     expect(dependency.id).toEqual(3);\r\n\t *   }\r\n\t * }\r\n\t * ```\r\n\t * This directive would be instantiated with `Dependency` declared at the same element, in this case\r\n\t * `dependency=\"3\"`.\r\n\t *\r\n\t * ### Injecting a directive from any ancestor elements\r\n\t *\r\n\t * Directives can inject other directives declared on any ancestor element (in the current Shadow\r\n\t * DOM), i.e. on the current element, the\r\n\t * parent element, or its parents.\r\n\t * ```\r\n\t * @Directive({ selector: '[my-directive]' })\r\n\t * class MyDirective {\r\n\t *   constructor(@Host() dependency: Dependency) {\r\n\t *     expect(dependency.id).toEqual(2);\r\n\t *   }\r\n\t * }\r\n\t * ```\r\n\t *\r\n\t * `@Host` checks the current element, the parent, as well as its parents recursively. If\r\n\t * `dependency=\"2\"` didn't\r\n\t * exist on the direct parent, this injection would\r\n\t * have returned\r\n\t * `dependency=\"1\"`.\r\n\t *\r\n\t *\r\n\t * ### Injecting a live collection of direct child directives\r\n\t *\r\n\t *\r\n\t * A directive can also query for other child directives. Since parent directives are instantiated\r\n\t * before child directives, a directive can't simply inject the list of child directives. Instead,\r\n\t * the directive injects a {@link QueryList}, which updates its contents as children are added,\r\n\t * removed, or moved by a directive that uses a {@link ViewContainerRef} such as a `ngFor`, an\r\n\t * `ngIf`, or an `ngSwitch`.\r\n\t *\r\n\t * ```\r\n\t * @Directive({ selector: '[my-directive]' })\r\n\t * class MyDirective {\r\n\t *   constructor(@Query(Dependency) dependencies:QueryList<Dependency>) {\r\n\t *   }\r\n\t * }\r\n\t * ```\r\n\t *\r\n\t * This directive would be instantiated with a {@link QueryList} which contains `Dependency` 4 and\r\n\t * `Dependency` 6. Here, `Dependency` 5 would not be included, because it is not a direct child.\r\n\t *\r\n\t * ### Injecting a live collection of descendant directives\r\n\t *\r\n\t * By passing the descendant flag to `@Query` above, we can include the children of the child\r\n\t * elements.\r\n\t *\r\n\t * ```\r\n\t * @Directive({ selector: '[my-directive]' })\r\n\t * class MyDirective {\r\n\t *   constructor(@Query(Dependency, {descendants: true}) dependencies:QueryList<Dependency>) {\r\n\t *   }\r\n\t * }\r\n\t * ```\r\n\t *\r\n\t * This directive would be instantiated with a Query which would contain `Dependency` 4, 5 and 6.\r\n\t *\r\n\t * ### Optional injection\r\n\t *\r\n\t * The normal behavior of directives is to return an error when a specified dependency cannot be\r\n\t * resolved. If you\r\n\t * would like to inject `null` on unresolved dependency instead, you can annotate that dependency\r\n\t * with `@Optional()`.\r\n\t * This explicitly permits the author of a template to treat some of the surrounding directives as\r\n\t * optional.\r\n\t *\r\n\t * ```\r\n\t * @Directive({ selector: '[my-directive]' })\r\n\t * class MyDirective {\r\n\t *   constructor(@Optional() dependency:Dependency) {\r\n\t *   }\r\n\t * }\r\n\t * ```\r\n\t *\r\n\t * This directive would be instantiated with a `Dependency` directive found on the current element.\r\n\t * If none can be\r\n\t * found, the injector supplies `null` instead of throwing an error.\r\n\t *\r\n\t * ### Example\r\n\t *\r\n\t * Here we use a decorator directive to simply define basic tool-tip behavior.\r\n\t *\r\n\t * ```\r\n\t * @Directive({\r\n\t *   selector: '[tooltip]',\r\n\t *   inputs: [\r\n\t *     'text: tooltip'\r\n\t *   ],\r\n\t *   host: {\r\n\t *     '(mouseenter)': 'onMouseEnter()',\r\n\t *     '(mouseleave)': 'onMouseLeave()'\r\n\t *   }\r\n\t * })\r\n\t * class Tooltip{\r\n\t *   text:string;\r\n\t *   overlay:Overlay; // NOT YET IMPLEMENTED\r\n\t *   overlayManager:OverlayManager; // NOT YET IMPLEMENTED\r\n\t *\r\n\t *   constructor(overlayManager:OverlayManager) {\r\n\t *     this.overlay = overlay;\r\n\t *   }\r\n\t *\r\n\t *   onMouseEnter() {\r\n\t *     // exact signature to be determined\r\n\t *     this.overlay = this.overlayManager.open(text, ...);\r\n\t *   }\r\n\t *\r\n\t *   onMouseLeave() {\r\n\t *     this.overlay.close();\r\n\t *     this.overlay = null;\r\n\t *   }\r\n\t * }\r\n\t * ```\r\n\t * In our HTML template, we can then add this behavior to a `<div>` or any other element with the\r\n\t * `tooltip` selector,\r\n\t * like so:\r\n\t *\r\n\t * ```\r\n\t * <div tooltip=\"some text here\"></div>\r\n\t * ```\r\n\t *\r\n\t * Directives can also control the instantiation, destruction, and positioning of inline template\r\n\t * elements:\r\n\t *\r\n\t * A directive uses a {@link ViewContainerRef} to instantiate, insert, move, and destroy views at\r\n\t * runtime.\r\n\t * The {@link ViewContainerRef} is created as a result of `<template>` element, and represents a\r\n\t * location in the current view\r\n\t * where these actions are performed.\r\n\t *\r\n\t * Views are always created as children of the current {@link ViewMetadata}, and as siblings of the\r\n\t * `<template>` element. Thus a\r\n\t * directive in a child view cannot inject the directive that created it.\r\n\t *\r\n\t * Since directives that create views via ViewContainers are common in Angular, and using the full\r\n\t * `<template>` element syntax is wordy, Angular\r\n\t * also supports a shorthand notation: `<li *foo=\"bar\">` and `<li template=\"foo: bar\">` are\r\n\t * equivalent.\r\n\t *\r\n\t * Thus,\r\n\t *\r\n\t * ```\r\n\t * <ul>\r\n\t *   <li *foo=\"bar\" title=\"text\"></li>\r\n\t * </ul>\r\n\t * ```\r\n\t *\r\n\t * Expands in use to:\r\n\t *\r\n\t * ```\r\n\t * <ul>\r\n\t *   <template [foo]=\"bar\">\r\n\t *     <li title=\"text\"></li>\r\n\t *   </template>\r\n\t * </ul>\r\n\t * ```\r\n\t *\r\n\t * Notice that although the shorthand places `*foo=\"bar\"` within the `<li>` element, the binding for\r\n\t * the directive\r\n\t * controller is correctly instantiated on the `<template>` element rather than the `<li>` element.\r\n\t *\r\n\t * ## Lifecycle hooks\r\n\t *\r\n\t * When the directive class implements some {@link angular2/lifecycle_hooks} the callbacks are\r\n\t * called by the change detection at defined points in time during the life of the directive.\r\n\t *\r\n\t * ### Example\r\n\t *\r\n\t * Let's suppose we want to implement the `unless` behavior, to conditionally include a template.\r\n\t *\r\n\t * Here is a simple directive that triggers on an `unless` selector:\r\n\t *\r\n\t * ```\r\n\t * @Directive({\r\n\t *   selector: '[unless]',\r\n\t *   inputs: ['unless']\r\n\t * })\r\n\t * export class Unless {\r\n\t *   viewContainer: ViewContainerRef;\r\n\t *   templateRef: TemplateRef;\r\n\t *   prevCondition: boolean;\r\n\t *\r\n\t *   constructor(viewContainer: ViewContainerRef, templateRef: TemplateRef) {\r\n\t *     this.viewContainer = viewContainer;\r\n\t *     this.templateRef = templateRef;\r\n\t *     this.prevCondition = null;\r\n\t *   }\r\n\t *\r\n\t *   set unless(newCondition) {\r\n\t *     if (newCondition && (isBlank(this.prevCondition) || !this.prevCondition)) {\r\n\t *       this.prevCondition = true;\r\n\t *       this.viewContainer.clear();\r\n\t *     } else if (!newCondition && (isBlank(this.prevCondition) || this.prevCondition)) {\r\n\t *       this.prevCondition = false;\r\n\t *       this.viewContainer.create(this.templateRef);\r\n\t *     }\r\n\t *   }\r\n\t * }\r\n\t * ```\r\n\t *\r\n\t * We can then use this `unless` selector in a template:\r\n\t * ```\r\n\t * <ul>\r\n\t *   <li *unless=\"expr\"></li>\r\n\t * </ul>\r\n\t * ```\r\n\t *\r\n\t * Once the directive instantiates the child view, the shorthand notation for the template expands\r\n\t * and the result is:\r\n\t *\r\n\t * ```\r\n\t * <ul>\r\n\t *   <template [unless]=\"exp\">\r\n\t *     <li></li>\r\n\t *   </template>\r\n\t *   <li></li>\r\n\t * </ul>\r\n\t * ```\r\n\t *\r\n\t * Note also that although the `<li></li>` template still exists inside the `<template></template>`,\r\n\t * the instantiated\r\n\t * view occurs on the second `<li></li>` which is a sibling to the `<template>` element.\r\n\t */\r\n\tvar DirectiveMetadata = (function (_super) {\r\n\t    __extends(DirectiveMetadata, _super);\r\n\t    function DirectiveMetadata(_a) {\r\n\t        var _b = _a === void 0 ?

When the\r\n\t * directive's `selector` matches\r\n\t * elements in the DOM, the following steps occur:\r\n\t *\r\n\t * 1. For each directive, the `ElementInjector` attempts to resolve the directive's constructor\r\n\t * arguments.\r\n\t * 2. Angular instantiates directives for each matched element using `ElementInjector` in a\r\n\t * depth-first order,\r\n\t *    as declared in the HTML.\r\n\t *\r\n\t * ## Understanding How Injection Works\r\n\t *\r\n\t * There are three stages of injection resolution.\r\n\t * - *Pre-existing Injectors*:\r\n\t *   - The terminal {@link Injector} cannot resolve dependencies. It either throws an error or, if\r\n\t * the dependency was\r\n\t *     specified as `@Optional`, returns `null`.\r\n\t *   - The platform injector resolves browser singleton resources, such as: cookies, title,\r\n\t * location, and others.\r\n\t * - *Component Injectors*: Each component instance has its own {@link Injector}, and they follow\r\n\t * the same parent-child hierarchy\r\n\t *     as the component instances in the DOM.\r\n\t * - *Element Injectors*: Each component instance has a Shadow DOM. Within the Shadow DOM each\r\n\t * element has an `ElementInjector`\r\n\t *     which follow the same parent-child hierarchy as the DOM elements themselves.\r\n\t *\r\n\t * When a template is instantiated, it also must instantiate the corresponding directives in a\r\n\t * depth-first order. The\r\n\t * current `ElementInjector` resolves the constructor dependencies for each directive.\r\n\t *\r\n\t * Angular then resolves dependencies as follows, according to the order in which they appear in the\r\n\t * {@link ViewMetadata}:\r\n\t *\r\n\t * 1. Dependencies on the current element\r\n\t * 2. Dependencies on element injectors and their parents until it encounters a Shadow DOM boundary\r\n\t * 3. Dependencies on component injectors and their parents until it encounters the root component\r\n\t * 4. Dependencies on pre-existing injectors\r\n\t *\r\n\t *\r\n\t * The `ElementInjector` can inject other directives, element-specific special objects, or it can\r\n\t * delegate to the parent\r\n\t * injector.\r\n\t *\r\n\t * To inject other directives, declare the constructor parameter as:\r\n\t * - `directive:DirectiveType`: a directive on the current element only\r\n\t * - `@Host() directive:DirectiveType`: any directive that matches the type between the current\r\n\t * element and the\r\n\t *    Shadow DOM root.\r\n\t * - `@Query(DirectiveType) query:QueryList<DirectiveType>`: A live collection of direct child\r\n\t * directives.\r\n\t * - `@QueryDescendants(DirectiveType) query:QueryList<DirectiveType>`: A live collection of any\r\n\t * child directives.\r\n\t *\r\n\t * To inject element-specific special objects, declare the constructor parameter as:\r\n\t * - `element: ElementRef` to obtain a reference to logical element in the view.\r\n\t * - `viewContainer: ViewContainerRef` to control child template instantiation, for\r\n\t * {@link DirectiveMetadata} directives only\r\n\t * - `bindingPropagation: BindingPropagation` to control change detection in a more granular way.\r\n\t *\r\n\t * ### Example\r\n\t *\r\n\t * The following example demonstrates how dependency injection resolves constructor arguments in\r\n\t * practice.\r\n\t *\r\n\t *\r\n\t * Assume this HTML template:\r\n\t *\r\n\t * ```\r\n\t * <div dependency=\"1\">\r\n\t *   <div dependency=\"2\">\r\n\t *     <div dependency=\"3\" my-directive>\r\n\t *       <div dependency=\"4\">\r\n\t *         <div dependency=\"5\"></div>\r\n\t *       </div>\r\n\t *       <div dependency=\"6\"></div>\r\n\t *     </div>\r\n\t *   </div>\r\n\t * </div>\r\n\t * ```\r\n\t *\r\n\t * With the following `dependency` decorator and `SomeService` injectable class.\r\n\t *\r\n\t * ```\r\n\t * @Injectable()\r\n\t * class SomeService {\r\n\t * }\r\n\t *\r\n\t * @Directive({\r\n\t *   selector: '[dependency]',\r\n\t *   inputs: [\r\n\t *     'id: dependency'\r\n\t *   ]\r\n\t * })\r\n\t * class Dependency {\r\n\t *   id:string;\r\n\t * }\r\n\t * ```\r\n\t *\r\n\t * Let's step through the different ways in which `MyDirective` could be declared...\r\n\t *\r\n\t *\r\n\t * ### No injection\r\n\t *\r\n\t * Here the constructor is declared with no arguments, therefore nothing is injected into\r\n\t * `MyDirective`.\r\n\t *\r\n\t * ```\r\n\t * @Directive({ selector: '[my-directive]' })\r\n\t * class MyDirective {\r\n\t *   constructor() {\r\n\t *   }\r\n\t * }\r\n\t * ```\r\n\t *\r\n\t * This directive would be instantiated with no dependencies.\r\n\t *\r\n\t *\r\n\t * ### Component-level injection\r\n\t *\r\n\t * Directives can inject any injectable instance from the closest component injector or any of its\r\n\t * parents.\r\n\t *\r\n\t * Here, the constructor declares a parameter, `someService`, and injects the `SomeService` type\r\n\t * from the parent\r\n\t * component's injector.\r\n\t * ```\r\n\t * @Directive({ selector: '[my-directive]' })\r\n\t * class MyDirective {\r\n\t *   constructor(someService: SomeService) {\r\n\t *   }\r\n\t * }\r\n\t * ```\r\n\t *\r\n\t * This directive would be instantiated with a dependency on `SomeService`.\r\n\t *\r\n\t *\r\n\t * ### Injecting a directive from the current element\r\n\t *\r\n\t * Directives can inject other directives declared on the current element.\r\n\t *\r\n\t * ```\r\n\t * @Directive({ selector: '[my-directive]' })\r\n\t * class MyDirective {\r\n\t *   constructor(dependency: Dependency) {\r\n\t *     expect(dependency.id).toEqual(3);\r\n\t *   }\r\n\t * }\r\n\t * ```\r\n\t * This directive would be instantiated with `Dependency` declared at the same element, in this case\r\n\t * `dependency=\"3\"`.\r\n\t *\r\n\t * ### Injecting a directive from any ancestor elements\r\n\t *\r\n\t * Directives can inject other directives declared on any ancestor element (in the current Shadow\r\n\t * DOM), i.e. on the current element, the\r\n\t * parent element, or its parents.\r\n\t * ```\r\n\t * @Directive({ selector: '[my-directive]' })\r\n\t * class MyDirective {\r\n\t *   constructor(@Host() dependency: Dependency) {\r\n\t *     expect(dependency.id).toEqual(2);\r\n\t *   }\r\n\t * }\r\n\t * ```\r\n\t *\r\n\t * `@Host` checks the current element, the parent, as well as its parents recursively. If\r\n\t * `dependency=\"2\"` didn't\r\n\t * exist on the direct parent, this injection would\r\n\t * have returned\r\n\t * `dependency=\"1\"`.\r\n\t *\r\n\t *\r\n\t * ### Injecting a live collection of direct child directives\r\n\t *\r\n\t *\r\n\t * A directive can also query for other child directives. Since parent directives are instantiated\r\n\t * before child directives, a directive can't simply inject the list of child directives. Instead,\r\n\t * the directive injects a {@link QueryList}, which updates its contents as children are added,\r\n\t * removed, or moved by a directive that uses a {@link ViewContainerRef} such as a `ngFor`, an\r\n\t * `ngIf`, or an `ngSwitch`.\r\n\t *\r\n\t * ```\r\n\t * @Directive({ selector: '[my-directive]' })\r\n\t * class MyDirective {\r\n\t *   constructor(@Query(Dependency) dependencies:QueryList<Dependency>) {\r\n\t *   }\r\n\t * }\r\n\t * ```\r\n\t *\r\n\t * This directive would be instantiated with a {@link QueryList} which contains `Dependency` 4 and\r\n\t * 6. Here, `Dependency` 5 would not be included, because it is not a direct child.\r\n\t *\r\n\t * ### Injecting a live collection of descendant directives\r\n\t *\r\n\t * By passing the descendant flag to `@Query` above, we can include the children of the child\r\n\t * elements.\r\n\t *\r\n\t * ```\r\n\t * @Directive({ selector: '[my-directive]' })\r\n\t * class MyDirective {\r\n\t *   constructor(@Query(Dependency, {descendants: true}) dependencies:QueryList<Dependency>) {\r\n\t *   }\r\n\t * }\r\n\t * ```\r\n\t *\r\n\t * This directive would be instantiated with a Query which would contain `Dependency` 4, 5 and 6.\r\n\t *\r\n\t * ### Optional injection\r\n\t *\r\n\t * The normal behavior of directives is to return an error when a specified dependency cannot be\r\n\t * resolved. If you\r\n\t * would like to inject `null` on unresolved dependency instead, you can annotate that dependency\r\n\t * with `@Optional()`.\r\n\t * This explicitly permits the author of a template to treat some of the surrounding directives as\r\n\t * optional.\r\n\t *\r\n\t * ```\r\n\t * @Directive({ selector: '[my-directive]' })\r\n\t * class MyDirective {\r\n\t *   constructor(@Optional() dependency:Dependency) {\r\n\t *   }\r\n\t * }\r\n\t * ```\r\n\t *\r\n\t * This directive would be instantiated with a `Dependency` directive found on the current element.\r\n\t * If none can be\r\n\t * found, the injector supplies `null` instead of throwing an error.\r\n\t *\r\n\t * ### Example\r\n\t *\r\n\t * Here we use a decorator directive to simply define basic tool-tip behavior.\r\n\t *\r\n\t * ```\r\n\t * @Directive({\r\n\t *   selector: '[tooltip]',\r\n\t *   inputs: [\r\n\t *     'text: tooltip'\r\n\t *   ],\r\n\t *   host: {\r\n\t *     '(mouseenter)': 'onMouseEnter()',\r\n\t *     '(mouseleave)': 'onMouseLeave()'\r\n\t *   }\r\n\t * })\r\n\t * class Tooltip{\r\n\t *   text:string;\r\n\t *   overlay:Overlay; // NOT YET IMPLEMENTED\r\n\t *   overlayManager:OverlayManager; // NOT YET IMPLEMENTED\r\n\t *\r\n\t *   constructor(overlayManager:OverlayManager) {\r\n\t *     this.overlay = overlay;\r\n\t *   }\r\n\t *\r\n\t *   onMouseEnter() {\r\n\t *     // exact signature to be determined\r\n\t *     this.overlay = this.overlayManager.open(text, ...);\r\n\t *   }\r\n\t *\r\n\t *   onMouseLeave() {\r\n\t *     this.overlay.close();\r\n\t *     this.overlay = null;\r\n\t *   }\r\n\t * }\r\n\t * ```\r\n\t * In our HTML template, we can then add this behavior to a `<div>` or any other element with the\r\n\t * `tooltip` selector,\r\n\t * like so:\r\n\t *\r\n\t * ```\r\n\t * <div tooltip=\"some text here\"></div>\r\n\t * ```\r\n\t *\r\n\t * Directives can also control the instantiation, destruction, and positioning of inline template\r\n\t * elements:\r\n\t *\r\n\t * A directive uses a {@link ViewContainerRef} to instantiate, insert, move, and destroy views at\r\n\t * runtime.\r\n\t * The {@link ViewContainerRef} is created as a result of `<template>` element, and represents a\r\n\t * location in the current view\r\n\t * where these actions are performed.\r\n\t *\r\n\t * Views are always created as children of the current {@link ViewMetadata}, and as siblings of the\r\n\t * `<template>` element. Thus a\r\n\t * directive in a child view cannot inject the directive that created it.\r\n\t *\r\n\t * Since directives that create views via ViewContainers are common in Angular, and using the full\r\n\t * `<template>` element syntax is wordy, Angular\r\n\t * also supports a shorthand notation: `<li *foo=\"bar\">` and `<li template=\"foo: bar\">` are\r\n\t * equivalent.\r\n\t *\r\n\t * Thus,\r\n\t *\r\n\t * ```\r\n\t * <ul>\r\n\t *   <li *foo=\"bar\" title=\"text\"></li>\r\n\t * </ul>\r\n\t * ```\r\n\t *\r\n\t * Expands in use to:\r\n\t *\r\n\t * ```\r\n\t * <ul>\r\n\t *   <template [foo]=\"bar\">\r\n\t *     <li title=\"text\"></li>\r\n\t *   </template>\r\n\t * </ul>\r\n\t * ```\r\n\t *\r\n\t * Notice that although the shorthand places `*foo=\"bar\"` within the `<li>` element, the binding for\r\n\t * the directive\r\n\t * controller is correctly instantiated on the `<template>` element rather than the `<li>` element.\r\n\t *\r\n\t * ## Lifecycle hooks\r\n\t *\r\n\t * When the directive class implements some {@link angular2/lifecycle_hooks} the callbacks are\r\n\t * called by the change detection at defined points in time during the life of the directive.\r\n\t *\r\n\t * ### Example\r\n\t *\r\n\t * Let's suppose we want to implement the `unless` behavior, to conditionally include a template.\r\n\t *\r\n\t * Here is a simple directive that triggers on an `unless` selector:\r\n\t *\r\n\t * ```\r\n\t * @Directive({\r\n\t *   selector: '[unless]',\r\n\t *   inputs: ['unless']\r\n\t * })\r\n\t * export class Unless {\r\n\t *   viewContainer: ViewContainerRef;\r\n\t *   templateRef: TemplateRef;\r\n\t *   prevCondition: boolean;\r\n\t *\r\n\t *   constructor(viewContainer: ViewContainerRef, templateRef: TemplateRef) {\r\n\t *     this.viewContainer = viewContainer;\r\n\t *     this.templateRef = templateRef;\r\n\t *     this.prevCondition = null;\r\n\t *   }\r\n\t *\r\n\t *   set unless(newCondition) {\r\n\t *     if (newCondition && (isBlank(this.prevCondition) || !this.prevCondition)) {\r\n\t *       this.prevCondition = true;\r\n\t *       this.viewContainer.clear();\r\n\t *     } else if (!newCondition && (isBlank(this.prevCondition) || this.prevCondition)) {\r\n\t *       this.prevCondition = false;\r\n\t *       this.viewContainer.create(this.templateRef);\r\n\t *     }\r\n\t *   }\r\n\t * }\r\n\t * ```\r\n\t *\r\n\t * We can then use this `unless` selector in a template:\r\n\t * ```\r\n\t * <ul>\r\n\t *   <li *unless=\"expr\"></li>\r\n\t * </ul>\r\n\t * ```\r\n\t *\r\n\t * Once the directive instantiates the child view, the shorthand notation for the template expands\r\n\t * and the result is:\r\n\t *\r\n\t * ```\r\n\t * <ul>\r\n\t *   <template [unless]=\"exp\">\r\n\t *     <li></li>\r\n\t *   </template>\r\n\t *   <li></li>\r\n\t * </ul>\r\n\t * ```\r\n\t *\r\n\t * Note also that although the `<li></li>` template still exists inside the `<template></template>`,\r\n\t * the instantiated\r\n\t * view occurs on the second `<li></li>` which is a sibling to the `<template>` element.\r\n\t */\r\n\texports.Directive = decorators_1.makeDecorator(directives_2.DirectiveMetadata);\r\n\t// TODO(alexeagle): remove the duplication of this doc.

evaluation result:\r\n\t * - `string` - all the CSS classes listed in a string (space delimited) are added\r\n\t * - `Array` - all the CSS classes (Array elements) are added\r\n\t * - `Object` - each key corresponds to a CSS class name while values are interpreted as expressions\r\n\t * evaluating to `Boolean`. If a given expression evaluates to `true` a corresponding CSS class\r\n\t * is added - otherwise it is removed.\r\n\t *\r\n\t * While the `NgClass` directive can interpret expressions evaluating to `string`, `Array`\r\n\t * or `Object`, the `Object`-based version is the most often used and has an advantage of keeping\r\n\t * all the CSS class names in a template.\r\n\t *\r\n\t * ### Example ([live demo](http://plnkr.co/edit/a4YdtmWywhJ33uqfpPPn?p=preview)):\r\n\t *\r\n\t * ```\r\n\t * import {Component} from 'angular2/core';\r\n\t * import {NgClass} from 'angular2/common';\r\n\t *\r\n\t * @Component({\r\n\t *   selector: 'toggle-button',\r\n\t *   inputs: ['isDisabled'],\r\n\t *   template: `\r\n\t *      <div class=\"button\" [ngClass]=\"{active: isOn, disabled: isDisabled}\"\r\n\t *          (click)=\"toggle(!isOn)\">\r\n\t *          Click me!\r\n\t *      </div>`,\r\n\t *   styles: [`\r\n\t *     .button {\r\n\t *       width: 120px;\r\n\t *       border: medium solid black;\r\n\t *     }\r\n\t *\r\n\t *     .active {\r\n\t *       background-color: red;\r\n\t *    }\r\n\t *\r\n\t *     .disabled {\r\n\t *       color: gray;\r\n\t *       border: medium solid gray;\r\n\t *     }\r\n\t *   `]\r\n\t *   directives: [NgClass]\r\n\t * })\r\n\t * class ToggleButton {\r\n\t *   isOn = false;\r\n\t *   isDisabled = false;\r\n\t *\r\n\t *   toggle(newState) {\r\n\t *     if (!this.isDisabled) {\r\n\t *       this.isOn = newState;\r\n\t *     }\r\n\t *   }\r\n\t * }\r\n\t * ```\r\n\t */\r\n\tvar NgClass = (function () {\r\n\t    function NgClass(_iterableDiffers, _keyValueDiffers, _ngEl, _renderer) {\r\n\t        this._iterableDiffers = _iterableDiffers;\r\n\t        this._keyValueDiffers = _keyValueDiffers;\r\n\t        this._ngEl = _ngEl;\r\n\t        this._renderer = _renderer;\r\n\t        this._initialClasses = [];\r\n\t    }\r\n\t    Object.defineProperty(NgClass.prototype, \"initialClasses\", {\r\n\t        set: function (v) {\r\n\t            this._applyInitialClasses(true);\r\n\t            this._initialClasses = lang_1.isPresent(v) && lang_1.isString(v) ? v.split(' ') : [];\r\n\t            this._applyInitialClasses(false);\r\n\t            this._applyClasses(this._rawClass, false);\r\n\t        },\r\n\t        enumerable: true,\r\n\t        configurable: true\r\n\t    });\r\n\t    Object.defineProperty(NgClass.prototype, \"rawClass\", {\r\n\t        set: function (v) {\r\n\t            this._cleanupClasses(this._rawClass);\r\n\t            if (lang_1.isString(v)) {\r\n\t                v = v.split(' ');\r\n\t            }\r\n\t            this._rawClass = v;\r\n\t            this._iterableDiffer = null;\r\n\t            this._keyValueDiffer = null;\r\n\t            if (lang_1.isPresent(v)) {\r\n\t                if (collection_1.isListLikeIterable(v)) {\r\n\t                    this._iterableDiffer = this._iterableDiffers.find(v).create(null);\r\n\t                }\r\n\t                else {\r\n\t                    this._keyValueDiffer = this._keyValueDiffers.find(v).create(null);\r\n\t                }\r\n\t            }\r\n\t        },\r\n\t        enumerable: true,\r\n\t        configurable: true\r\n\t    });\r\n\t    NgClass.prototype.ngDoCheck = function () {\r\n\t        if (lang_1.isPresent(this._iterableDiffer)) {\r\n\t            var changes = this._iterableDiffer.diff(this._rawClass);\r\n\t            if (lang_1.isPresent(changes)) {\r\n\t                this._applyIterableChanges(changes);\r\n\t            }\r\n\t        }\r\n\t        if (lang_1.isPresent(this._keyValueDiffer)) {\r\n\t            var changes = this._keyValueDiffer.diff(this._rawClass);\r\n\t            if (lang_1.isPresent(changes)) {\r\n\t                this._applyKeyValueChanges(changes);\r\n\t            }\r\n\t        }\r\n\t    };\r\n\t    NgClass.prototype.ngOnDestroy = function () { this._cleanupClasses(this._rawClass);

Promises that are rejected have a rejection reason and are in the\n\t      rejected state.  A fulfillment value is never a thenable.\n\t\n\t      Promises can also be said to *resolve* a value.  If this value is also a\n\t      promise, then the original promise's settled state will match the value's\n\t      settled state.  So a promise that *resolves* a promise that rejects will\n\t      itself reject, and a promise that *resolves* a promise that fulfills will\n\t      itself fulfill.\n\t\n\t\n\t      Basic Usage:\n\t      ------------\n\t\n\t      ```js\n\t      var promise = new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {\n\t        // on success\n\t        resolve(value);\n\t\n\t        // on failure\n\t        reject(reason);\n\t      });\n\t\n\t      promise.then(function(value) {\n\t        // on fulfillment\n\t      }, function(reason) {\n\t        // on rejection\n\t      });\n\t      ```\n\t\n\t      Advanced Usage:\n\t      ---------------\n\t\n\t      Promises shine when abstracting away asynchronous interactions such as\n\t      `XMLHttpRequest`s.\n\t\n\t      ```js\n\t      function getJSON(url) {\n\t        return new Promise(function(resolve, reject){\n\t          var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();\n\t\n\t          xhr.open('GET', url);\n\t          xhr.onreadystatechange = handler;\n\t          xhr.responseType = 'json';\n\t          xhr.setRequestHeader('Accept', 'application/json');\n\t          xhr.send();\n\t\n\t          function handler() {\n\t            if (this.readyState === this.DONE) {\n\t              if (this.status === 200) {\n\t                resolve(this.response);\n\t              } else {\n\t                reject(new Error('getJSON: `' + url + '` failed with status: [' + this.status + ']'));\n\t              }\n\t            }\n\t          };\n\t        });\n\t      }\n\t\n\t      getJSON('/posts.json').then(function(json) {\n\t        // on fulfillment\n\t      }, function(reason) {\n\t        // on rejection\n\t      });\n\t      ```\n\t\n\t      Unlike callbacks, promises are great composable primitives.\n\t\n\t      ```js\n\t      Promise.all([\n\t        getJSON('/posts'),\n\t        getJSON('/comments')\n\t      ]).then(function(values){\n\t        values[0] // => postsJSON\n\t        values[1] // => commentsJSON\n\t\n\t        return values;\n\t      });\n\t      ```\n\t\n\t      @class Promise\n\t      @param {function} resolver\n\t      Useful for tooling.\n\t      @constructor\n\t    */\n\t    function lib$es6$promise$promise$$Promise(resolver) {\n\t      this._id = lib$es6$promise$promise$$counter++;\n\t      this._state = undefined;\n\t      this._result = undefined;\n\t      this._subscribers = [];\n\t\n\t      if (lib$es6$promise$$internal$$noop !== resolver) {\n\t        typeof resolver !== 'function' && lib$es6$promise$promise$$needsResolver();\n\t        this instanceof lib$es6$promise$promise$$Promise ? lib$es6$promise$$internal$$initializePromise(this, resolver) : lib$es6$promise$promise$$needsNew();\n\t      }\n\t    }\n\t\n\t    lib$es6$promise$promise$$Promise.all = lib$es6$promise$promise$all$$default;\n\t    lib$es6$promise$promise$$Promise.race = lib$es6$promise$promise$race$$default;\n\t    lib$es6$promise$promise$$Promise.resolve = lib$es6$promise$promise$resolve$$default;\n\t    lib$es6$promise$promise$$Promise.reject = lib$es6$promise$promise$reject$$default;\n\t    lib$es6$promise$promise$$Promise._setScheduler = lib$es6$promise$asap$$setScheduler;\n\t    lib$es6$promise$promise$$Promise._setAsap = lib$es6$promise$asap$$setAsap;\n\t    lib$es6$promise$promise$$Promise._asap = lib$es6$promise$asap$$asap;\n\t\n\t    lib$es6$promise$promise$$Promise.prototype = {\n\t      constructor: lib$es6$promise$promise$$Promise,\n\t\n\t    /**\n\t      The primary way of interacting with a promise is through its `then` method,\n\t      which registers callbacks to receive either a promise's eventual value or the\n\t      reason why the promise cannot be fulfilled.\n\t\n\t      ```js\n\t      findUser().then(function(user){\n\t        // user is available\n\t      }, function(reason){\n\t        // user is unavailable, and you are given the reason why\n\t      });\n\t      ```\n\t\n\t      Chaining\n\t      --------\n\t\n\t      The return value of `then` is itself a promise.

When the\n * directive's `selector` matches\n * elements in the DOM, the following steps occur:\n *\n * 1. For each directive, the `ElementInjector` attempts to resolve the directive's constructor\n * arguments.\n * 2. Angular instantiates directives for each matched element using `ElementInjector` in a\n * depth-first order,\n *    as declared in the HTML.\n *\n * ## Understanding How Injection Works\n *\n * There are three stages of injection resolution.\n * - *Pre-existing Injectors*:\n *   - The terminal {@link Injector} cannot resolve dependencies. It either throws an error or, if\n * the dependency was\n *     specified as `@Optional`, returns `null`.\n *   - The platform injector resolves browser singleton resources, such as: cookies, title,\n * location, and others.\n * - *Component Injectors*: Each component instance has its own {@link Injector}, and they follow\n * the same parent-child hierarchy\n *     as the component instances in the DOM.\n * - *Element Injectors*: Each component instance has a Shadow DOM. Within the Shadow DOM each\n * element has an `ElementInjector`\n *     which follow the same parent-child hierarchy as the DOM elements themselves.\n *\n * When a template is instantiated, it also must instantiate the corresponding directives in a\n * depth-first order. The\n * current `ElementInjector` resolves the constructor dependencies for each directive.\n *\n * Angular then resolves dependencies as follows, according to the order in which they appear in the\n * {@link ViewMetadata}:\n *\n * 1. Dependencies on the current element\n * 2. Dependencies on element injectors and their parents until it encounters a Shadow DOM boundary\n * 3. Dependencies on component injectors and their parents until it encounters the root component\n * 4. Dependencies on pre-existing injectors\n *\n *\n * The `ElementInjector` can inject other directives, element-specific special objects, or it can\n * delegate to the parent\n * injector.\n *\n * To inject other directives, declare the constructor parameter as:\n * - `directive:DirectiveType`: a directive on the current element only\n * - `@Host() directive:DirectiveType`: any directive that matches the type between the current\n * element and the\n *    Shadow DOM root.\n * - `@Query(DirectiveType) query:QueryList<DirectiveType>`: A live collection of direct child\n * directives.\n * - `@QueryDescendants(DirectiveType) query:QueryList<DirectiveType>`: A live collection of any\n * child directives.\n *\n * To inject element-specific special objects, declare the constructor parameter as:\n * - `element: ElementRef` to obtain a reference to logical element in the view.\n * - `viewContainer: ViewContainerRef` to control child template instantiation, for\n * {@link DirectiveMetadata} directives only\n * - `bindingPropagation: BindingPropagation` to control change detection in a more granular way.\n *\n * ### Example\n *\n * The following example demonstrates how dependency injection resolves constructor arguments in\n * practice.\n *\n *\n * Assume this HTML template:\n *\n * ```\n * <div dependency=\"1\">\n *   <div dependency=\"2\">\n *     <div dependency=\"3\" my-directive>\n *       <div dependency=\"4\">\n *         <div dependency=\"5\"></div>\n *       </div>\n *       <div dependency=\"6\"></div>\n *     </div>\n *   </div>\n * </div>\n * ```\n *\n * With the following `dependency` decorator and `SomeService` injectable class.\n *\n * ```\n * @Injectable()\n * class SomeService {\n * }\n *\n * @Directive({\n *   selector: '[dependency]',\n *   inputs: [\n *     'id: dependency'\n *   ]\n * })\n * class Dependency {\n *   id:string;\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * Let's step through the different ways in which `MyDirective` could be declared...\n *\n *\n * ### No injection\n *\n * Here the constructor is declared with no arguments, therefore nothing is injected into\n * `MyDirective`.\n *\n * ```\n * @Directive({ selector: '[my-directive]' })\n * class MyDirective {\n *   constructor() {\n *   }\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * This directive would be instantiated with no dependencies.\n *\n *\n * ### Component-level injection\n *\n * Directives can inject any injectable instance from the closest component injector or any of its\n * parents.\n *\n * Here, the constructor declares a parameter, `someService`, and injects the `SomeService` type\n * from the parent\n * component's injector.\n * ```\n * @Directive({ selector: '[my-directive]' })\n * class MyDirective {\n *   constructor(someService: SomeService) {\n *   }\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * This directive would be instantiated with a dependency on `SomeService`.\n *\n *\n * ### Injecting a directive from the current element\n *\n * Directives can inject other directives declared on the current element.\n *\n * ```\n * @Directive({ selector: '[my-directive]' })\n * class MyDirective {\n *   constructor(dependency: Dependency) {\n *     expect(dependency.id).toEqual(3);\n *   }\n * }\n * ```\n * This directive would be instantiated with `Dependency` declared at the same element, in this case\n * `dependency=\"3\"`.\n *\n * ### Injecting a directive from any ancestor elements\n *\n * Directives can inject other directives declared on any ancestor element (in the current Shadow\n * DOM), i.e. on the current element, the\n * parent element, or its parents.\n * ```\n * @Directive({ selector: '[my-directive]' })\n * class MyDirective {\n *   constructor(@Host() dependency: Dependency) {\n *     expect(dependency.id).toEqual(2);\n *   }\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * `@Host` checks the current element, the parent, as well as its parents recursively. If\n * `dependency=\"2\"` didn't\n * exist on the direct parent, this injection would\n * have returned\n * `dependency=\"1\"`.\n *\n *\n * ### Injecting a live collection of direct child directives\n *\n *\n * A directive can also query for other child directives. Since parent directives are instantiated\n * before child directives, a directive can't simply inject the list of child directives. Instead,\n * the directive injects a {@link QueryList}, which updates its contents as children are added,\n * removed, or moved by a directive that uses a {@link ViewContainerRef} such as a `ngFor`, an\n * `ngIf`, or an `ngSwitch`.\n *\n * ```\n * @Directive({ selector: '[my-directive]' })\n * class MyDirective {\n *   constructor(@Query(Dependency) dependencies:QueryList<Dependency>) {\n *   }\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * This directive would be instantiated with a {@link QueryList} which contains `Dependency` 4 and\n * `Dependency` 6. Here, `Dependency` 5 would not be included, because it is not a direct child.\n *\n * ### Injecting a live collection of descendant directives\n *\n * By passing the descendant flag to `@Query` above, we can include the children of the child\n * elements.\n *\n * ```\n * @Directive({ selector: '[my-directive]' })\n * class MyDirective {\n *   constructor(@Query(Dependency, {descendants: true}) dependencies:QueryList<Dependency>) {\n *   }\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * This directive would be instantiated with a Query which would contain `Dependency` 4, 5 and 6.\n *\n * ### Optional injection\n *\n * The normal behavior of directives is to return an error when a specified dependency cannot be\n * resolved. If you\n * would like to inject `null` on unresolved dependency instead, you can annotate that dependency\n * with `@Optional()`.\n * This explicitly permits the author of a template to treat some of the surrounding directives as\n * optional.\n *\n * ```\n * @Directive({ selector: '[my-directive]' })\n * class MyDirective {\n *   constructor(@Optional() dependency:Dependency) {\n *   }\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * This directive would be instantiated with a `Dependency` directive found on the current element.\n * If none can be\n * found, the injector supplies `null` instead of throwing an error.\n *\n * ### Example\n *\n * Here we use a decorator directive to simply define basic tool-tip behavior.\n *\n * ```\n * @Directive({\n *   selector: '[tooltip]',\n *   inputs: [\n *     'text: tooltip'\n *   ],\n *   host: {\n *     '(mouseenter)': 'onMouseEnter()',\n *     '(mouseleave)': 'onMouseLeave()'\n *   }\n * })\n * class Tooltip{\n *   text:string;\n *   overlay:Overlay; // NOT YET IMPLEMENTED\n *   overlayManager:OverlayManager; // NOT YET IMPLEMENTED\n *\n *   constructor(overlayManager:OverlayManager) {\n *     this.overlay = overlay;\n *   }\n *\n *   onMouseEnter() {\n *     // exact signature to be determined\n *     this.overlay = this.overlayManager.open(text, ...);\n *   }\n *\n *   onMouseLeave() {\n *     this.overlay.close();\n *     this.overlay = null;\n *   }\n * }\n * ```\n * In our HTML template, we can then add this behavior to a `<div>` or any other element with the\n * `tooltip` selector,\n * like so:\n *\n * ```\n * <div tooltip=\"some text here\"></div>\n * ```\n *\n * Directives can also control the instantiation, destruction, and positioning of inline template\n * elements:\n *\n * A directive uses a {@link ViewContainerRef} to instantiate, insert, move, and destroy views at\n * runtime.\n * The {@link ViewContainerRef} is created as a result of `<template>` element, and represents a\n * location in the current view\n * where these actions are performed.\n *\n * Views are always created as children of the current {@link ViewMetadata}, and as siblings of the\n * `<template>` element. Thus a\n * directive in a child view cannot inject the directive that created it.\n *\n * Since directives that create views via ViewContainers are common in Angular, and using the full\n * `<template>` element syntax is wordy, Angular\n * also supports a shorthand notation: `<li *foo=\"bar\">` and `<li template=\"foo: bar\">` are\n * equivalent.\n *\n * Thus,\n *\n * ```\n * <ul>\n *   <li *foo=\"bar\" title=\"text\"></li>\n * </ul>\n * ```\n *\n * Expands in use to:\n *\n * ```\n * <ul>\n *   <template [foo]=\"bar\">\n *     <li title=\"text\"></li>\n *   </template>\n * </ul>\n * ```\n *\n * Notice that although the shorthand places `*foo=\"bar\"` within the `<li>` element, the binding for\n * the directive\n * controller is correctly instantiated on the `<template>` element rather than the `<li>` element.\n *\n * ## Lifecycle hooks\n *\n * When the directive class implements some {@link angular2/lifecycle_hooks} the callbacks are\n * called by the change detection at defined points in time during the life of the directive.\n *\n * ### Example\n *\n * Let's suppose we want to implement the `unless` behavior, to conditionally include a template.\n *\n * Here is a simple directive that triggers on an `unless` selector:\n *\n * ```\n * @Directive({\n *   selector: '[unless]',\n *   inputs: ['unless']\n * })\n * export class Unless {\n *   viewContainer: ViewContainerRef;\n *   templateRef: TemplateRef;\n *   prevCondition: boolean;\n *\n *   constructor(viewContainer: ViewContainerRef, templateRef: TemplateRef) {\n *     this.viewContainer = viewContainer;\n *     this.templateRef = templateRef;\n *     this.prevCondition = null;\n *   }\n *\n *   set unless(newCondition) {\n *     if (newCondition && (isBlank(this.prevCondition) || !this.prevCondition)) {\n *       this.prevCondition = true;\n *       this.viewContainer.clear();\n *     } else if (!newCondition && (isBlank(this.prevCondition) || this.prevCondition)) {\n *       this.prevCondition = false;\n *       this.viewContainer.create(this.templateRef);\n *     }\n *   }\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * We can then use this `unless` selector in a template:\n * ```\n * <ul>\n *   <li *unless=\"expr\"></li>\n * </ul>\n * ```\n *\n * Once the directive instantiates the child view, the shorthand notation for the template expands\n * and the result is:\n *\n * ```\n * <ul>\n *   <template [unless]=\"exp\">\n *     <li></li>\n *   </template>\n *   <li></li>\n * </ul>\n * ```\n *\n * Note also that although the `<li></li>` template still exists inside the `<template></template>`,\n * the instantiated\n * view occurs on the second `<li></li>` which is a sibling to the `<template>` element.\n */\n@CONST()\nexport class DirectiveMetadata extends

It is copied from DirectiveMetadata.\n/**\n * Directives allow you to attach behavior to elements in the DOM.\n *\n * {@link DirectiveMetadata}s with an embedded view are called {@link ComponentMetadata}s.\n *\n * A directive consists of a single directive annotation and a controller class. When the\n * directive's `selector` matches\n * elements in the DOM, the following steps occur:\n *\n * 1. For each directive, the `ElementInjector` attempts to resolve the directive's constructor\n * arguments.\n * 2. Angular instantiates directives for each matched element using `ElementInjector` in a\n * depth-first order,\n *    as declared in the HTML.\n *\n * ## Understanding How Injection Works\n *\n * There are three stages of injection resolution.\n * - *Pre-existing Injectors*:\n *   - The terminal {@link Injector} cannot resolve dependencies. It either throws an error or, if\n * the dependency was\n *     specified as `@Optional`, returns `null`.\n *   - The platform injector resolves browser singleton resources, such as: cookies, title,\n * location, and others.\n * - *Component Injectors*: Each component instance has its own {@link Injector}, and they follow\n * the same parent-child hierarchy\n *     as the component instances in the DOM.\n * - *Element Injectors*: Each component instance has a Shadow DOM. Within the Shadow DOM each\n * element has an `ElementInjector`\n *     which follow the same parent-child hierarchy as the DOM elements themselves.\n *\n * When a template is instantiated, it also must instantiate the corresponding directives in a\n * depth-first order. The\n * current `ElementInjector` resolves the constructor dependencies for each directive.\n *\n * Angular then resolves dependencies as follows, according to the order in which they appear in the\n * {@link ViewMetadata}:\n *\n * 1. Dependencies on the current element\n * 2. Dependencies on element injectors and their parents until it encounters a Shadow DOM boundary\n * 3. Dependencies on component injectors and their parents until it encounters the root component\n * 4. Dependencies on pre-existing injectors\n *\n *\n * The `ElementInjector` can inject other directives, element-specific special objects, or it can\n * delegate to the parent\n * injector.\n *\n * To inject other directives, declare the constructor parameter as:\n * - `directive:DirectiveType`: a directive on the current element only\n * - `@Host() directive:DirectiveType`: any directive that matches the type between the current\n * element and the\n *    Shadow DOM root.\n * - `@Query(DirectiveType) query:QueryList<DirectiveType>`: A live collection of direct child\n * directives.\n * - `@QueryDescendants(DirectiveType) query:QueryList<DirectiveType>`: A live collection of any\n * child directives.\n *\n * To inject element-specific special objects, declare the constructor parameter as:\n * - `element: ElementRef` to obtain a reference to logical element in the view.\n * - `viewContainer: ViewContainerRef` to control child template instantiation, for\n * {@link DirectiveMetadata} directives only\n * - `bindingPropagation: BindingPropagation` to control change detection in a more granular way.\n *\n * ### Example\n *\n * The following example demonstrates how dependency injection resolves constructor arguments in\n * practice.\n *\n *\n * Assume this HTML template:\n *\n * ```\n * <div dependency=\"1\">\n *   <div dependency=\"2\">\n *     <div dependency=\"3\" my-directive>\n *       <div dependency=\"4\">\n *         <div dependency=\"5\"></div>\n *       </div>\n *       <div dependency=\"6\"></div>\n *     </div>\n *   </div>\n * </div>\n * ```\n *\n * With the following `dependency` decorator and `SomeService` injectable class.\n *\n * ```\n * @Injectable()\n * class SomeService {\n * }\n *\n * @Directive({\n *   selector: '[dependency]',\n *   inputs: [\n *     'id: dependency'\n *   ]\n * })\n * class Dependency {\n *   id:string;\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * Let's step through the different ways in which `MyDirective` could be declared...\n *\n *\n * ### No injection\n *\n * Here the constructor is declared with no arguments, therefore nothing is injected into\n * `MyDirective`.\n *\n * ```\n * @Directive({ selector: '[my-directive]' })\n * class MyDirective {\n *   constructor() {\n *   }\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * This directive would be instantiated with no dependencies.\n *\n *\n * ### Component-level injection\n *\n * Directives can inject any injectable instance from the closest component injector or any of its\n * parents.\n *\n * Here, the constructor declares a parameter, `someService`, and injects the `SomeService` type\n * from the parent\n * component's injector.\n * ```\n * @Directive({ selector: '[my-directive]' })\n * class MyDirective {\n *   constructor(someService: SomeService) {\n *   }\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * This directive would be instantiated with a dependency on `SomeService`.\n *\n *\n * ### Injecting a directive from the current element\n *\n * Directives can inject other directives declared on the current element.\n *\n * ```\n * @Directive({ selector: '[my-directive]' })\n * class MyDirective {\n *   constructor(dependency: Dependency) {\n *     expect(dependency.id).toEqual(3);\n *   }\n * }\n * ```\n * This directive would be instantiated with `Dependency` declared at the same element, in this case\n * `dependency=\"3\"`.\n *\n * ### Injecting a directive from any ancestor elements\n *\n * Directives can inject other directives declared on any ancestor element (in the current Shadow\n * DOM), i.e. on the current element, the\n * parent element, or its parents.\n * ```\n * @Directive({ selector: '[my-directive]' })\n * class MyDirective {\n *   constructor(@Host() dependency: Dependency) {\n *     expect(dependency.id).toEqual(2);\n *   }\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * `@Host` checks the current element, the parent, as well as its parents recursively. If\n * `dependency=\"2\"` didn't\n * exist on the direct parent, this injection would\n * have returned\n * `dependency=\"1\"`.\n *\n *\n * ### Injecting a live collection of direct child directives\n *\n *\n * A directive can also query for other child directives. Since parent directives are instantiated\n * before child directives, a directive can't simply inject the list of child directives. Instead,\n * the directive injects a {@link QueryList}, which updates its contents as children are added,\n * removed, or moved by a directive that uses a {@link ViewContainerRef} such as a `ngFor`, an\n * `ngIf`, or an `ngSwitch`.\n *\n * ```\n * @Directive({ selector: '[my-directive]' })\n * class MyDirective {\n *   constructor(@Query(Dependency) dependencies:QueryList<Dependency>) {\n *   }\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * This directive would be instantiated with a {@link QueryList} which contains `Dependency` 4 and\n * 6. Here, `Dependency` 5 would not be included, because it is not a direct child.\n *\n * ### Injecting a live collection of descendant directives\n *\n * By passing the descendant flag to `@Query` above, we can include the children of the child\n * elements.\n *\n * ```\n * @Directive({ selector: '[my-directive]' })\n * class MyDirective {\n *   constructor(@Query(Dependency, {descendants: true}) dependencies:QueryList<Dependency>) {\n *   }\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * This directive would be instantiated with a Query which would contain `Dependency` 4, 5 and 6.\n *\n * ### Optional injection\n *\n * The normal behavior of directives is to return an error when a specified dependency cannot be\n * resolved. If you\n * would like to inject `null` on unresolved dependency instead, you can annotate that dependency\n * with `@Optional()`.\n * This explicitly permits the author of a template to treat some of the surrounding directives as\n * optional.\n *\n * ```\n * @Directive({ selector: '[my-directive]' })\n * class MyDirective {\n *   constructor(@Optional() dependency:Dependency) {\n *   }\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * This directive would be instantiated with a `Dependency` directive found on the current element.\n * If none can be\n * found, the injector supplies `null` instead of throwing an error.\n *\n * ### Example\n *\n * Here we use a decorator directive to simply define basic tool-tip behavior.\n *\n * ```\n * @Directive({\n *   selector: '[tooltip]',\n *   inputs: [\n *     'text: tooltip'\n *   ],\n *   host: {\n *     '(mouseenter)': 'onMouseEnter()',\n *     '(mouseleave)': 'onMouseLeave()'\n *   }\n * })\n * class Tooltip{\n *   text:string;\n *   overlay:Overlay; // NOT YET IMPLEMENTED\n *   overlayManager:OverlayManager; // NOT YET IMPLEMENTED\n *\n *   constructor(overlayManager:OverlayManager) {\n *     this.overlay = overlay;\n *   }\n *\n *   onMouseEnter() {\n *     // exact signature to be determined\n *     this.overlay = this.overlayManager.open(text, ...);\n *   }\n *\n *   onMouseLeave() {\n *     this.overlay.close();\n *     this.overlay = null;\n *   }\n * }\n * ```\n * In our HTML template, we can then add this behavior to a `<div>` or any other element with the\n * `tooltip` selector,\n * like so:\n *\n * ```\n * <div tooltip=\"some text here\"></div>\n * ```\n *\n * Directives can also control the instantiation, destruction, and positioning of inline template\n * elements:\n *\n * A directive uses a {@link ViewContainerRef} to instantiate, insert, move, and destroy views at\n * runtime.\n * The {@link ViewContainerRef} is created as a result of `<template>` element, and represents a\n * location in the current view\n * where these actions are performed.\n *\n * Views are always created as children of the current {@link ViewMetadata}, and as siblings of the\n * `<template>` element. Thus a\n * directive in a child view cannot inject the directive that created it.\n *\n * Since directives that create views via ViewContainers are common in Angular, and using the full\n * `<template>` element syntax is wordy, Angular\n * also supports a shorthand notation: `<li *foo=\"bar\">` and `<li template=\"foo: bar\">` are\n * equivalent.\n *\n * Thus,\n *\n * ```\n * <ul>\n *   <li *foo=\"bar\" title=\"text\"></li>\n * </ul>\n * ```\n *\n * Expands in use to:\n *\n * ```\n * <ul>\n *   <template [foo]=\"bar\">\n *     <li title=\"text\"></li>\n *   </template>\n * </ul>\n * ```\n *\n * Notice that although the shorthand places `*foo=\"bar\"` within the `<li>` element, the binding for\n * the directive\n * controller is correctly instantiated on the `<template>` element rather than the `<li>` element.\n *\n * ## Lifecycle hooks\n *\n * When the directive class implements some {@link angular2/lifecycle_hooks} the callbacks are\n * called by the change detection at defined points in time during the life of the directive.\n *\n * ### Example\n *\n * Let's suppose we want to implement the `unless` behavior, to conditionally include a template.\n *\n * Here is a simple directive that triggers on an `unless` selector:\n *\n * ```\n * @Directive({\n *   selector: '[unless]',\n *   inputs: ['unless']\n * })\n * export class Unless {\n *   viewContainer: ViewContainerRef;\n *   templateRef: TemplateRef;\n *   prevCondition: boolean;\n *\n *   constructor(viewContainer: ViewContainerRef, templateRef: TemplateRef) {\n *     this.viewContainer = viewContainer;\n *     this.templateRef = templateRef;\n *     this.prevCondition = null;\n *   }\n *\n *   set unless(newCondition) {\n *     if (newCondition && (isBlank(this.prevCondition) || !this.prevCondition)) {\n *       this.prevCondition = true;\n *       this.viewContainer.clear();\n *     } else if (!newCondition && (isBlank(this.prevCondition) || this.prevCondition)) {\n *       this.prevCondition = false;\n *       this.viewContainer.create(this.templateRef);\n *     }\n *   }\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * We can then use this `unless` selector in a template:\n * ```\n * <ul>\n *   <li *unless=\"expr\"></li>\n * </ul>\n * ```\n *\n * Once the directive instantiates the child view, the shorthand notation for the template expands\n * and the result is:\n *\n * ```\n * <ul>\n *   <template [unless]=\"exp\">\n *     <li></li>\n *   </template>\n *   <li></li>\n * </ul>\n * ```\n *\n * Note also that although the `<li></li>` template still exists inside the `<template></template>`,\n * the instantiated\n * view occurs on the second `<li></li>` which is a sibling to the `<template>` element.\n */\nexport var Directive: DirectiveFactory = <DirectiveFactory>makeDecorator(DirectiveMetadata);\n\n// TODO(alexeagle): remove the duplication of this doc.

classes listed in a string (space delimited) are added\n * - `Array` - all the CSS classes (Array elements) are added\n * - `Object` - each key corresponds to a CSS class name while values are interpreted as expressions\n * evaluating to `Boolean`. If a given expression evaluates to `true` a corresponding CSS class\n * is added - otherwise it is removed.\n *\n * While the `NgClass` directive can interpret expressions evaluating to `string`, `Array`\n * or `Object`, the `Object`-based version is the most often used and has an advantage of keeping\n * all the CSS class names in a template.\n *\n * ### Example ([live demo](http://plnkr.co/edit/a4YdtmWywhJ33uqfpPPn?p=preview)):\n *\n * ```\n * import {Component} from 'angular2/core';\n * import {NgClass} from 'angular2/common';\n *\n * @Component({\n *   selector: 'toggle-button',\n *   inputs: ['isDisabled'],\n *   template: `\n *      <div class=\"button\" [ngClass]=\"{active: isOn, disabled: isDisabled}\"\n *          (click)=\"toggle(!isOn)\">\n *          Click me!\n *      </div>`,\n *   styles: [`\n *     .button {\n *       width: 120px;\n *       border: medium solid black;\n *     }\n *\n *     .active {\n *       background-color: red;\n *    }\n *\n *     .disabled {\n *       color: gray;\n *       border: medium solid gray;\n *     }\n *   `]\n *   directives: [NgClass]\n * })\n * class ToggleButton {\n *   isOn = false;\n *   isDisabled = false;\n *\n *   toggle(newState) {\n *     if (!this.isDisabled) {\n *       this.isOn = newState;\n *     }\n *   }\n * }\n * ```\n */\n@Directive({selector: '[ngClass]', inputs: ['rawClass: ngClass', 'initialClasses: class']})\nexport class NgClass implements DoCheck, OnDestroy {\n  private _iterableDiffer: IterableDiffer;\n  private _keyValueDiffer: KeyValueDiffer;\n  private _initialClasses: string[] = [];\n  private _rawClass: string[] | Set<string>;\n\n  constructor(private _iterableDiffers: IterableDiffers, private _keyValueDiffers: KeyValueDiffers,\n              private _ngEl: ElementRef, private _renderer: Renderer) {}\n\n  set initialClasses(v: string) {\n    this._applyInitialClasses(true);\n    this._initialClasses = isPresent(v) && isString(v) ?

This has important implications for animations and any stateful\n * controls\n * (such as `<input>` elements which accept user input) that are present. Inserted rows can be\n * animated in, deleted rows can be animated out, and unchanged rows retain any unsaved state such\n * as user input.\n *\n * It is possible for the identities of elements in the iterator to change while the data does not.\n * This can happen, for example, if the iterator produced from an RPC to the server, and that\n * RPC is re-run. Even if the data hasn't changed, the second response will produce objects with\n * different identities, and Angular will tear down the entire DOM and rebuild it (as if all old\n * elements were deleted and all new elements inserted).

The\n      primary way of interacting with a promise is through its `then` method, which\n      registers callbacks to receive either a promise's eventual value or the reason\n      why the promise cannot be fulfilled.\n\n      Terminology\n      -----------\n\n      - `promise` is an object or function with a `then` method whose behavior conforms to this specification.\n      - `thenable` is an object or function that defines a `then` method.\n      - `value` is any legal JavaScript value (including undefined, a thenable, or a promise).\n      - `exception` is a value that is thrown using the throw statement.\n      - `reason` is a value that indicates why a promise was rejected.\n      - `settled` the final resting state of a promise, fulfilled or rejected.\n\n      A promise can be in one of three states: pending, fulfilled, or rejected.\n\n      Promises that are fulfilled have a fulfillment value and are in the fulfilled\n      state.  Promises that are rejected have a rejection reason and are in the\n      rejected state.  A fulfillment value is never a thenable.\n\n      Promises can also be said to *resolve* a value.  If this value is also a\n      promise, then the original promise's settled state will match the value's\n      settled state.  So a promise that *resolves* a promise that rejects will\n      itself reject, and a promise that *resolves* a promise that fulfills will\n      itself fulfill.\n\n\n      Basic Usage:\n      ------------\n\n      ```js\n      var promise = new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {\n        // on success\n        resolve(value);\n\n        // on failure\n        reject(reason);\n      });\n\n      promise.then(function(value) {\n        // on fulfillment\n      }, function(reason) {\n        // on rejection\n      });\n      ```\n\n      Advanced Usage:\n      ---------------\n\n      Promises shine when abstracting away asynchronous interactions such as\n      `XMLHttpRequest`s.\n\n      ```js\n      function getJSON(url) {\n        return new Promise(function(resolve, reject){\n          var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();\n\n          xhr.open('GET', url);\n          xhr.onreadystatechange = handler;\n          xhr.responseType = 'json';\n          xhr.setRequestHeader('Accept', 'application/json');\n          xhr.send();\n\n          function handler() {\n            if (this.readyState === this.DONE) {\n              if (this.status === 200) {\n                resolve(this.response);\n              } else {\n                reject(new Error('getJSON: `' + url + '` failed with status: [' + this.status + ']'));\n              }\n            }\n          };\n        });\n      }\n\n      getJSON('/posts.json').then(function(json) {\n        // on fulfillment\n      }, function(reason) {\n        // on rejection\n      });\n      ```\n\n      Unlike callbacks, promises are great composable primitives.\n\n      ```js\n      Promise.all([\n        getJSON('/posts'),\n        getJSON('/comments')\n      ]).then(function(values){\n        values[0] // => postsJSON\n        values[1] // => commentsJSON\n\n        return values;\n      });\n      ```\n\n      @class Promise\n      @param {function} resolver\n      Useful for tooling.\n      @constructor\n    */\n    function lib$es6$promise$promise$$Promise(resolver) {\n      this._id = lib$es6$promise$promise$$counter++;\n      this._state = undefined;\n      this._result = undefined;\n      this._subscribers = [];\n\n      if (lib$es6$promise$$internal$$noop !== resolver) {\n        typeof resolver !== 'function' && lib$es6$promise$promise$$needsResolver();\n        this instanceof lib$es6$promise$promise$$Promise ? lib$es6$promise$$internal$$initializePromise(this, resolver) : lib$es6$promise$promise$$needsNew();\n      }\n    }\n\n    lib$es6$promise$promise$$Promise.all = lib$es6$promise$promise$all$$default;\n    lib$es6$promise$promise$$Promise.race = lib$es6$promise$promise$race$$default;\n    lib$es6$promise$promise$$Promise.resolve = lib$es6$promise$promise$resolve$$default;\n    lib$es6$promise$promise$$Promise.reject = lib$es6$promise$promise$reject$$default;\n    lib$es6$promise$promise$$Promise._setScheduler = lib$es6$promise$asap$$setScheduler;\n    lib$es6$promise$promise$$Promise._setAsap = lib$es6$promise$asap$$setAsap;\n    lib$es6$promise$promise$$Promise._asap = lib$es6$promise$asap$$asap;\n\n    lib$es6$promise$promise$$Promise.prototype = {\n      constructor: lib$es6$promise$promise$$Promise,\n\n    /**\n      The primary way of interacting with a promise is through its `then` method,\n      which registers callbacks to receive either a promise's eventual value or the\n      reason why the promise cannot be fulfilled.\n\n      ```js\n      findUser().then(function(user){\n        // user is available\n      }, function(reason){\n        // user is unavailable, and you are given the reason why\n      });\n      ```\n\n      Chaining\n      --------\n\n      The return value of `then` is itself a promise.  This second, 'downstream'\n      promise is resolved with the return value of the first promise's fulfillment\n      or rejection handler, or rejected if the handler throws an exception.\n\n      ```js\n      findUser().then(function (user) {\n        return user.name;\n      }, function (reason) {\n        return 'default name';\n      }).then(function (userName) {\n        // If `findUser` fulfilled, `userName` will be the user's name, otherwise it\n        // will be `'default name'`\n      });\n\n      findUser().then(function (user) {\n        throw new Error('Found user, but still unhappy');\n      }, function (reason) {\n        throw new Error('`findUser` rejected and we're unhappy');\n      }).then(function (value) {\n        // never reached\n      }, function (reason) {\n        // if `findUser` fulfilled, `reason` will be 'Found user, but still unhappy'.\n        // If `findUser` rejected, `reason` will be '`findUser` rejected and we're unhappy'.\n      });\n      ```\n      If the downstream promise does not specify a rejection handler, rejection reasons will be propagated further downstream.\n\n      ```js\n      findUser().then(function (user) {\n        throw new PedagogicalException('Upstream error');\n      }).then(function (value) {\n        // never reached\n      }).then(function (value) {\n        // never reached\n      }, function (reason) {\n        // The `PedgagocialException` is propagated all the way down to here\n      });\n      ```\n\n      Assimilation\n      ------------\n\n      Sometimes the value you want to propagate to a downstream promise can only be\n      retrieved asynchronously. This can be achieved by returning a promise in the\n      fulfillment or rejection handler. The downstream promise will then be pending\n      until the returned promise is settled. This is called *assimilation*.\n\n      ```js\n      findUser().then(function (user) {\n        return findCommentsByAuthor(user);\n      }).then(function (comments) {\n        // The user's comments are now available\n      });\n      ```\n\n      If the assimliated promise rejects, then the downstream promise will also reject.\n\n      ```js\n      findUser().then(function (user) {\n        return findCommentsByAuthor(user);\n      }).then(function (comments) {\n        // If `findCommentsByAuthor` fulfills, we'll have the value here\n      }, function (reason) {\n        // If `findCommentsByAuthor` rejects, we'll have the reason here\n      });\n      ```\n\n      Simple Example\n      --------------\n\n      Synchronous Example\n\n      ```javascript\n      var result;\n\n      try {\n        result = findResult();\n        // success\n      } catch(reason) {\n        // failure\n      }\n      ```\n\n      Errback Example\n\n      ```js\n      findResult(function(result, err){\n        if (err) {\n          // failure\n        } else {\n          // success\n        }\n      });\n      ```\n\n      Promise Example;\n\n      ```javascript\n      findResult().then(function(result){\n        // success\n      }, function(reason){\n        // failure\n      });\n      ```\n\n      Advanced Example\n      --------------\n\n      Synchronous Example\n\n      ```javascript\n      var author, books;\n\n      try {\n        author = findAuthor();\n        books  = findBooksByAuthor(author);\n        // success\n      } catch(reason) {\n        // failure\n      }\n      ```\n\n      Errback Example\n\n      ```js\n\n      function foundBooks(books) {\n\n      }\n\n      function failure(reason) {\n\n      }\n\n      findAuthor(function(author, err){\n        if (err) {\n          failure(err);\n          // failure\n        } else {\n          try {\n            findBoooksByAuthor(author, function(books, err) {\n              if (err) {\n                failure(err);\n              } else {\n                try {\n                  foundBooks(books);\n                } catch(reason) {\n                  failure(reason);\n                }\n              }\n            });\n          } catch(error) {\n            failure(err);\n          }\n          // success\n        }\n      });\n      ```\n\n      Promise Example;\n\n      ```javascript\n      findAuthor().\n        then(findBooksByAuthor).\n        then(function(books){\n          // found books\n      }).catch(function(reason){\n        // something went wrong\n      });\n      ```\n\n      @method then\n      @param {Function} onFulfilled\n      @param {Function} onRejected\n      Useful for tooling.\n      @return {Promise}\n    */\n      then: lib$es6$promise$then$$default,\n\n    /**\n      `catch` is simply sugar for `then(undefined, onRejection)` which makes it the same\n      as the catch block of a try/catch statement.\n\n      ```js\n      function findAuthor(){\n        throw new Error('couldn't find that author');\n      }\n\n      // synchronous\n      try {\n        findAuthor();\n      } catch(reason) {\n        // something went wrong\n      }\n\n      // async with promises\n      findAuthor().catch(function(reason){\n        // something went wrong\n      });\n      ```\n\n      @method catch\n      @param {Function} onRejection\n      Useful for tooling.\n      @return {Promise}\n    */\n      'catch': function(onRejection) {\n        return this.then(null, onRejection);\n      }\n    };\n    var lib$es6$promise$enumerator$$default = lib$es6$promise$enumerator$$Enumerator;\n    function lib$es6$promise$enumerator$$Enumerator(Constructor, input) {\n      this._instanceConstructor = Constructor;\n      this.promise = new Constructor(lib$es6$promise$$internal$$noop);\n\n      if (Array.isArray(input)) {\n        this._input     = input;\n        this.length     = input.length;\n        this._remaining = input.length;\n\n        this._result = new Array(this.length);\n\n        if (this.length === 0) {\n          lib$es6$promise$$internal$$fulfill(this.promise, this._result);\n        } else {\n          this.length = this.length || 0;\n          this._enumerate();\n          if (this._remaining === 0) {\n            lib$es6$promise$$internal$$fulfill(this.promise, this._result);\n          }\n        }\n      } else {\n        lib$es6$promise$$internal$$reject(this.promise, this._validationError());\n      }\n    }\n\n    lib$es6$promise$enumerator$$Enumerator.prototype._validationError = function() {\n      return new Error('Array Methods must be provided an Array');\n    };\n\n    lib$es6$promise$enumerator$$Enumerator.prototype._enumerate = function() {\n      var length  = this.length;\n      var input   = this._input;\n\n      for (var i = 0;
